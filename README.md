# proudtobedev-skills
- This project is the skills trees used in the proudtobe.dev platform. 
- *Still don't have your skills page? Access https://proudtobe.dev, create your page and share!*

## How to contribute (simple and objective)
- Do not use the same skill name as the existing ones, as the list is dynamic and based on this repository, the comparison is by name. For example, in the Back-end > Languages category, there is "Java", but in the Mobile > Native category, there is also "Java", but it is named "Java (Mobile)".
- Keep the default of JSON files, only complement with new items;
- Keep the JSON files valid;
- Use only existing folders;
- Create new trees, add/modify items and submit your Pull Request for approval;

## Final notes
- We do not want to cover "a world of technologies" but the essential for mapping the most current technologies
